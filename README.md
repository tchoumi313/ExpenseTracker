# Expense-Tracker

## Description
Expense-Tracker is a MERN stack project designed to help users manage their monthly expenses. Users can register and sign in securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Once logged in, users have an initial expense limit of 10,000 for the month, which they can update as needed. Users can add expense items, and the amounts will be deducted from the monthly limit. The app provides a graphical representation of the remaining balance for the month. Users can also delete entered items and change the month to view previous month's expenses.
